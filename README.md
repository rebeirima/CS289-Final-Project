## The Effect of Gossip in Heterogeneous Swarms

From large herds of migrating bison to
human groups communicating to converge on
a policy decision, there are various instances
of decentralized swarms where agents with
differing amounts of information must
converge their behavior. Peer-to-peer
decentralized communication can allow
swarms to more reliably converge on a target,
something that has been studied in existing
gossip modelling and collective consensus
work. In this paper, we incorporate a gossip
model in a flocking algorithm, which allows
the flock to be controlled by a leader in a
decentralized manner, using gossip to
disseminate the signal about a target direction.
We show that, by varying our defined
parameters such as agent reliability, shyness,
we can modulate the swarm dynamics. We
find that the swarm converges on the leaderâ€™s
target direction to within 5 degrees.
